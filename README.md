# PyCAPI
A python module to access the Canvas LMS API and some Python scripts that use the module to do a variety of tasks.

# Sources
I am making full use of the Canvas LMS REST API manual (https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/index.html). I have also drawn inspiration from https://github.com/hawesie/python-canvas-api and https://github.com/mterwill/canvasgrader when starting this project.
